<h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
  <p>"I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try 
    to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or 
    books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, 
    which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to 
    live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. 
    Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even 
    noticing it, live your way into the answer."</p>
  <i>- Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet</i>
</br>
<p>"He went on to explain that when you start performing, you play for people who are just like you, and that's not really performing. Then you perform for people who just like you, and that's really fun. Then, "if you're lucky," you end up performing for people who want to be you, and that's really not as much fun because these people who want to be you always hate you a little because they're not you. They secretly want you to fail so you can know how it feels to be them. "Actually," he said, "it's not that complicated. There's a lot of people in a room. One guy's got the microphone. Everybody else's got the beer. They're all having about the same amount of fun."</p>
